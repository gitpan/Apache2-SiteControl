Version 1.0 has a significant change from previous versions. AccessController
is dropped in favor of a module actually called SiteControl. This makes the
whole system work better in the Perl sense, and make version checking and
installation smoother with CPAN.

To upgrade:

1) Edit all of your modules that depend on 
   Apache::SiteControl::AccessController, and change them to use 
   Apache::SiteControl.
2) Make the same change in all of your pages. i.e.:

   $user = Apache::SiteControl::AccessController->getPermissionManager($r)

   becomes:

   $user = Apache::SiteControl->getPermissionManager($r)

   i.e. 
   
   perl -pi'.bak' 's/SiteControl::AccessController/SiteControl/' *.html

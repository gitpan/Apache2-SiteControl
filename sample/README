WARNING: This sample is tuned for use with mod_perl 1.xx, NOT mod_perl2. Use
Apache2::SiteControl for mod_perl2 installations.

This is a complete sample. To set it up:

1) mkdir /tmp/sessions /tmp/session/locks and make sure apache will have
   read/write access to them.
2) Edit apache_modperlinit.pl and apache_sitecontrol.conf file and update the
   relevant paths and fields (location mappings). Use the Directory and Alias
   lines in this file to create a mapping for apache to this directory as
   /sample.
3) Restart apache and check logs.
4) Try to access /sample/page.html. 
   - You should be sent to the login page. 
     The valid logins are: admin/test and user/test.
   - You should see the page. If you are logged in as "admin", then you
     should have editable fields. If not, you should just see data.
5) Go to /sample/logout.html
   - You should see a logout message
6) Try to access /sample/page.html again.
   - You should see the login screen again.

Debugging is turned on in the default configuration, so check error_log in 
apache if you have problems.
